ðŸ“Š Diabetes Health Indicators Analysis
ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

This project explores the Diabetes Health Indicators dataset
The goal is to load, clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

It follows three main tasks:

1. Dataset Exploration & Cleaning

- Load dataset with pandas

- Inspect data using .head(), .info(), and check for missing values

- Clean the dataset by handling missing values

2. Basic Data Analysis

- Compute descriptive statistics (.describe())

- Group data by diabetes status (Diabetes_012) and compute average BMI

- Identify interesting findings and patterns

3. Data Visualization
- Created 4 different plots for insights:

- Histogram of BMI distribution

- Bar chart of average BMI by diabetes category

- Scatter plot of Age vs BMI, colored by diabetes status

- Line chart showing average BMI across age groups

ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.x

- pandas

- matplotlib

- seaborn
